        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>
          The reason i choose these four colors was because these are some of the most basic colors. You  will see a kindergarten teacher using these colors most of the time, reason being why is because like the kids are young and don't really know that much about complex colors so they use basic colors. Mostly everyone learns about these colors because these are the colors we see all over the place.
